# Tab-Menu for Jetpack Compose
[![Tab-Menu Showcase](http://share.gifyoutube.com/1W2zOq.gif)](https://youtu.be/Qdfu9zyeSBg)
## ðŸ“• Description
This component was created for a side-project of mine. 
It should be a simple and minimalistic version of a tab switching menu.

The goal of this project are:
 - A minimalistic and functional tab switching menu (like Androids or Microsoft Ribbon Menu)
 - Easy-to-use: The tabs only support text labels, and the onSelection handler is a callback function with just the clicked tab index as the parameter
 - Responsive to the width of its parent container -> the tab menu wrapper implements is scrollable
 - Support for touch and mouse input events
 - Self-made (for learning purposes)

**Disclaimer**: \
This is a project just for educational purpose. 
It was created for learning Jetpack Compose and creating components.
Further support is not guaranteed and intended by the creator.
